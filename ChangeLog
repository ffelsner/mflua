MFLua is able to procude ConcreteOT.svg from ccr10.mf without change the source.
ConcreteOT.otf can be produced from ConcrteOT.svg with latest fontforge, but it needs work (curves are not simplified, for example).

A new folder with ccr10 has started;
the folder ccr5 stays for historical reason, but the development is halted.
The goal is to produce an openType version with few glyphs for the next ConTeXT meeting on September 2011.  
There are so many bugs  that it's still a proof of concept ---  it's  not even an alpha quality.
